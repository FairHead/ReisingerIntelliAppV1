## Reporting a Vulnerability

The ReisingerIntelliAppV1 team takes security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by following these guidelines:

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities through one of these channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/FairHead/ReisingerIntelliAppV1/security) in our repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details about the vulnerability

2. **Email** (Alternative)
   - Send an email to the project maintainers
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Explanation of the potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions of the app are affected
- **Platform Information**: Specific platforms (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS) affected

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to ReisingerIntelliAppV1, please follow these security guidelines:

### Code Security
- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, certificates)
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS for all network communications
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

### Mobile App Security
- Use secure storage for sensitive data (never store in plain text)
- Implement certificate pinning for API communications
- Validate server certificates
- Use proper encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Follow platform-specific security guidelines (iOS, Android)

### Dependencies
- Keep all dependencies up to date
- Review dependency security advisories
- Use tools like `dotnet list package --vulnerable` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Be cautious when adding new dependencies

### Development Practices
- Enable and address code analysis warnings
- Use static analysis tools
- Implement proper logging (but avoid logging sensitive data)
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regularly review and update security configurations

## Known Security Considerations

The following security considerations are built into ReisingerIntelliAppV1:

### Data Protection
- Sensitive device credentials are stored using platform secure storage
- Network communications use HTTPS/TLS
- User data is encrypted at rest where applicable

### Network Security
- Certificate validation for API communications
- Timeout configurations to prevent resource exhaustion
- Input validation for all network requests

### Platform Security
- Platform-specific permission models are respected
- Secure coding practices for each target platform
- Regular security updates for dependencies

## Security Tools and Automation

We use several automated tools to help maintain security:

- **Dependabot**: Automatic dependency updates and vulnerability alerts
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Security Scanning**: Regular automated security scans in CI/CD
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging
